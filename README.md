Your crypto data is yours to keep; I built this so that you could own your data and manage the data in a convenient way without the need to send your coin data to anyone else.

These Google Apps‚Ñ¢ scripts will add menu commands to Google Sheets‚Ñ¢ that will help you track cost basis and long-term or short-term treatment for your cryptocurrency trades. 

It uses the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method, which is commonly used for tax compliance.

## Setup

Installation options can be found in the #üíªsetup channel within the [HODL Totals Discord](https://discord.gg/TWuA9DzZth)


## Setup (for Development)

üìù Steps required to run unit tests locally with `npm build`, `npm run test:unit`

> Install nvm (Node Version Manager)
>
> `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash`
>
> Install node.js, built for the most recent [Long-Term Support versions](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/)
> 
> `nvm install --lts`
>
> Install the latest npm version,
> 
> `npm install -g npm`
>
> From the directory with the HODL Totals source code, install the HODL Totals dependencies
>
> `npm install`

üìù Additional steps to set up a new Google sheet with HODL totals scripts

> Install [Google clasp](https://github.com/google/clasp), grant clasp access to your google account, create a sheet and push HODL Totals scripts to that sheet
>
> `npm install -g @google/clasp`
> 
> `clasp login` and then grant access in the browser window that opens
>
> `clasp create "<desired sheet name>" --type sheets`  
>
> `clasp push`  
>
> `clasp open` and then navigate in browser to the overview page
> 
> `clasp push` to upload the code you synced locally from this repo up to the Apps Script editor associated with your new sheet
>
> Navigate back to the sheet, refresh your browser and you will see a new hodl-totals pull right menu; Commands run from this menu will execute your copy of the code

üìù Additional steps to enable End-to-End integration tests to run on your copy of the code, using your Google account on your sheet

<!--
> Due to clasp breaking support for symbol export/import across  ES6-like-module boundaries
> https://github.com/grant/ts2gas/issues/26#issuecomment-1003428178
> Must freeze at the version of clasp that last worked v2.3.2
> This leads to a bunch of npm security vulernability alerts at npm install time
>
> If could upgrade to latest, then could use the --deploymentID flag and make E2E tests more seamless and not require a manual keypress to select deployment, by appending
> `--deploymentId AKfycbw0a1U_xiXP-nvYfDG6lHJSyCafrGeJkIPrzMmFMSk`
> to package.json's test:e2e cmd
>
> `clasp open` and then navigate in browser, click Deploy dropdwn, select Test Deployment, copy deployment ID out of the webapp URL
>
> `code package.json` to edit package.json locally, paste deploymentID over the test:e2e cmd's deployment ID
> 
--> 
> `npm run test:e2e` to run the E2E test suite -- or simply `npm test` to run both local and E2E test suites

## Development Environment

- Windows 10 PC with WSL2 (Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS)
- Node.js LTS version (16.x)
- Visual Studio Code on Windows 10, and its WSL2 integration for editing code stored in WSL
- GitHub CLI commands via the WSL2 Linux terminal
- Publish changes to your google sheet [using clasp](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/clasp) from the command line
