# HODL Totals

## Crypto taxes simplified for self-reliant HODLers

Crypto taxes are complicated, stressful, and a barrier to mainstream adoption. If you've accumulated numerous transactions but aren't a crypto whale, spending $2,000+ on tax services is impractical.

**HODL Totals** is your solution: a free, open-source Google Sheets™ add-on that empowers you to manage your crypto tax compliance with confidence.

## Our Philosophy

We don't offer another expensive service—we provide tools and knowledge to help you maintain compliance with tax laws independently. Our mission is to support crypto going mainstream by making tax reporting accessible to everyone.

Our software is open source under the [MIT License](https://github.com/dogracer/hodl-totals/blob/main/LICENSE), so you can inspect the code and verify how it works—unlike proprietary services used by many crypto tax companies.

**Your transaction data belongs to you.** Tax compliance shouldn't require surrendering your sensitive financial information to third-party services that could become targets for hackers, like [the service breached in August 2020](https://www.tokenpost.com/More-than-1000-users-affected-in-a-cryptocurrency-tax-reporting-service-hack-5712). With HODL Totals, you leverage Google Drive™ storage for a secure, cloud-based experience while maintaining control of your data.

## What HODL Totals Offers

### Comprehensive Transaction Tracking
- Transaction dates and IDs
- Coin inflows and outflows
- Real-time pricing data
- Wallet information
- Cryptocurrency addresses

### Data Verification
Use our reconciliation feature to validate your entries by confirming wallet/account balances match your transaction records.

### Customizable Tax Strategy
Navigate regulatory gray areas by customizing the Categories sheet to align with your preferred tax approach. Connect with our [Discord community](https://discord.com/invite/TWuA9DzZth) to discuss conservative or aggressive reporting strategies before making your decisions.

### Automatic Tax Calculations
Once your data is verified, our Google Sheets™ add-on calculates:
- Profit and loss figures
- Short-term capital gains
- Long-term capital gains
- Overall coin totals

All calculations use the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method, which is most commonly accepted for tax compliance.

### Beyond Basic Crypto
- **NFT Support**: Track NFT transactions alongside cryptocurrency to determine reportable events
- **DeFi Compatibility**: If it happens on-chain, HODL Totals can track it
